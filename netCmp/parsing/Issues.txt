Issue 1 (2015-11-29): change declaration of inheritance functions:
	Reason: to draw CFG using jointJS, one needs to create a viewport (i.e. run
	'new joint.dia.Paper({...})' command). But js crashes with a following error:
	>>> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function (jquery-1.11.3.min.js:4).
	Emperically, I determined that this error has to do with my util__lib.js file
	which had 3 functions for related to establishing inheritance (inheritFrom,
	ctorParent, and hashCode). They all were declared inside Object scope. For
	example: Object.prototype.inheritFrom = function(parentClass){...};
	When I converted this declaration into a regular function, so it is no longer
	accessible in every JS object, jointJS was able to construct viewport.
