Branches: (Some of the earlier branches have been skipped)
b_01 - re-design visualization unit based on Canvas. Previous work was using
  JointJS library, which was based on alternatiove technology - SVG. It proved
  to have certain limitations, one of the serious is its slowness, when drawing
  medium or large Control Flow Graphs (project 'soko' was usually taking around
  15 minutes to fully draw CFG. Hope is to speedup this process.
