> re-design visualization unit based on Canvas. Previous work was using JointJS library, which was based on alternatiove technology - SVG. It proved to have certain limitations, one of the serious is its slowness, when drawing medium or large Control Flow Graphs (project 'soko' was usually taking around 15 minutes to fully draw CFG. Hope is to speedup this process.
